### Installation
1. Open your terminal, and change directory into desired folder to copy to.
2. Copy this repository using an SSH key
3. Type in your terminal: git clone *COPIED SSH KEY*
4. After it copies to your machine, go into the designated files directory in your terminal.
5. Now open it with whatever code tool you have!
(I use VSCode so I just type "code ." in my terminal..without the quotation marks)

## START
Open the terminal, go to the file directory of the copied repo, then type -> ruby bin/run  in the terminal and follow the prompts! 

Note: You don't have to type the word "ruby" before hand if you have priviledges enabled with -> chmod + x filename.
